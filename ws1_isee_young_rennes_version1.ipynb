Investigating mixtures and the exposome allows researchers to assess the independent and combined effects of various exposures, as well as their potential synergistic or antagonistic effects, on health outcomes. However, the complexity of exploring these questions requires the use of specific statistical models to account for aspects that single-exposure models cannot typically handle (e.g. multicollinearity).\n",
