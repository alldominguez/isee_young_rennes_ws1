        "The exposome, described as 'the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards,' acknowledges that individuals are simultaneously exposed to multiple different environmental factors, adopting a holistic approach to discovering etiological factors of disease. The main advantage of the exposome approach over more traditional 'one exposure, one disease or health outcome' models is that it provides a framework for studying multiple environmental risks (urban, chemical, lifestyle, social, etc.) and their combined effects.\n",
