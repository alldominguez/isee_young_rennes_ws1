        "The study of mixtures and the exposome in the context of environmental epidemiological research is rapidly growing. Investigating mixtures or the exposome allows researchers to assess the independent and combined effects of various exposures, as well as their potential synergistic or antagonistic effects, on health outcomes. However, the complexity of exploring these questions requires the use of specific statistical models to account for aspects that single-exposure models cannot typically handle (e.g. multicollinearity).\n",

The main advantage of the exposome approach over more traditional 'one exposure, one disease or health outcome' models is that it provides a framework for studying multiple environmental risks (urban, chemical, lifestyle, social, etc.) and their combined effects.\n",
