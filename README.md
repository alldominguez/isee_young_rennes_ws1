## Introduction
The study of mixtures and the exposome in the context of environmental epidemiological research is rapidly
growing. Investigating mixtures or the exposome allows researchers to assess the
independent and combined effects of various exposures, as well as their potential synergistic or antagonistic
effects, on health outcomes. However, the complexity of exploring these questions requires the use of specific
statistical models to account for aspects that single-exposure models cannot typically handle (e.g.
multicollinearity). 

This workshop therefore aims at summarizing and presenting the main models used in this
specific context, and discussing the pros and cons of each method in relation to a specific study objectives.
