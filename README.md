## Introduction
The study of mixtures and the exposome in the context of environmental epidemiological research is rapidly
growing. Investigating mixtures or the exposome allows researchers to assess the
independent and combined effects of various exposures, as well as their potential synergistic or antagonistic
effects, on health outcomes. However, the complexity of exploring these questions requires the use of specific
statistical models to account for aspects that single-exposure models cannot typically handle (e.g.
multicollinearity). 

This workshop therefore aims at summarizing and presenting the main models used in this
specific context, and discussing the pros and cons of each method in relation to a specific study objectives.

## Notes for attendees

The workshop will be split into two parts

- **Theory (1h30):** During the first part, we will present.

  * **Aims** and statisticals **challenges/specificities** of mixture and exposome analyses.
  * A range of (non-exahustive) **statistical models** specific to mixture and/or the exposome with an example application for each method, that will cover: **exposome-wide association** study model (ExWAS), **mixture models** (e.g BKMR, WQS, and their externsions, etc), **variable selection methods** (e.g. DSA, ENET, (s)PLS, etc), and **dimension reduction/clustering** tools (e.g. PCA, HCPC).
  * **Pros and cons** of using each method.
  * **Comparative performances** of these methods.
  * The data **pre-processing steps** required to perform these analysis.
  * The **R packages avaiable to implement** these methods. 
   
- **Practice (1h):** We will give a dataset to participants along with codes for running methods presented in the theoretical parts. Each participant will then be able to apply one (or more) of the methods to answer one of the possible research questions in relation to the dataset. Workshop organizers will roam around the rooom to assist participants if needed. 

## Data
For this practical session, we will use data from the HELIX exposome study. The HELIX study is a collaborative project involving six longitudinal birth cohort studies, based on population data from six European countries (France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom).

**Note:** The data provided in this introductory course was simulated from the HELIX subcohort data. Details of the HELIX project and the source of the collected data can be found in the following publication: [BMJ Open - HELIX](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/9/e021311) and on the [project website](https://www.projecthelix.eu/es).


## Repository guide

In this repository, you will find the code and materials used during the **Workshop 1: Statistical methods for studying mixtures and the exposome**. To help you navigate the repository, its organization is described below.

The repository contains the following documents:

1.- **ws1_isee_young_rennes.ipynb:** Contains the notebook for the practical session with the necessary code to apply statistical methods for studying mixtures and the exposome.

2.- **data:** This folder contains the codebook and the datasets that will be used during the session.

The **exposome data (n = 1301)** we will use is contained in an **Rdata** file, which includes the following files:
  1. `phenotype` (outcpmes).
  2. `exposome` (exposures).
  3. `covariates` (covariates).
  4. `codebook`

The description of each variable (name, structure, variable type, transformation, etc.) is detailed in the codebook.

Additionaly, we will give you the option to use `R` and `Rstudio`. Here, we will use `quarto` to render and generate an `html`, which you can open directly in your browser. 




Enjoy the session and rest of the conference!
